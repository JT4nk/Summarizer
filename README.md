# Summarizer

> A simple text summarization in java

## Examples

``` bash
java Summarizer text-sample.txt

    A baby sucks on a pencil and her panicky mother fears the child will get lead poisoning. These are just a few examples of scientific illiteracy ' inane misconceptions that could have been avoided with a smidgen of freshman science. The costs of an ignorance of science are not just practical ones like misbegotten policies, forgone cures and a unilateral disarmament in national competitiveness.
